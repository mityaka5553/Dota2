# Dota2
Dota 2 is a multiplayer computer game of the MOBA genre. Players play matches with each other. Each match usually has 10 players. Matches are formed from a live queue, 
taking into account the level of play of all players. Before the start of the game, players are automatically divided into two teams of five. 
One team plays for the light side (The Radiant), the other for the dark side (The Dire). The goal of each team is to destroy the main building of the enemy base, the throne.

You need to build a model that, based on the data on the first five minutes of the match, will predict its outcome - that is, determine the winning team.

To complete this task, you need to conduct a series of studies, compare several machine learning algorithms, and test the effect of a number of feature manipulations. Also, if you 
enjoy working with this data, you can take part in a competition on Kaggle and compare your skills with other course participants!
The following files are attached to the task:

final-statement.ipynb and final-statement.html - statement of the problem, description of data, instructions for execution
features.zip - archive with training sample
features_test.zip - archive with a test sample
data.zip - full archive with raw data and a script to extract features (you only need this archive to participate in kaggle; you do not need it to complete this task)
extract_features.py - script that extracts features from raw data
